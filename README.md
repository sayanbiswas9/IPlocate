# About

IPLocate is a Python-based CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool, developed by [@sayanbiswas9](https://github.com/sayanbiswas9) with assistance from AI for error testing and syntax alignment. This tool allows users to get detailed information about an IP address. Its main motive is to bring the ipinfo search together in a simple program. You can use it just by typing `IPlocate` followed by the IP address you want to know info about or your own _Public IP Address_. Additionally, some new options are available that are different from any other tool available on the internet.
